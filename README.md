# February 15, 2017 Meetup

This month's meetup was all about testing. Sean Olszewski gave an excellent presentation on diving into testing. He helped us define some common jargon that is used to define and discuss testing. Sean also explained that tests are important because it helps prove the stability and efficacy of your code.
